    - Alright, here we go again.
    - So you'll immediately notice that, uh, the game ISN'T in 3D.
    - After the last playtest I started looking into how to 3D model, and that DID
      NOT go well.
    - I genuinely don't understand how people do it. They're sheer arcanists.
    - Sooo yeah, we're doing something a bit closer to comfort. I am NOT extruding
      any more in my life than I have to.
    - I've spent a lot of time making all the assets and putting it together, and
      if it gets criticised I *might* cry, so I'll just assume neutral-to-good feedback.
