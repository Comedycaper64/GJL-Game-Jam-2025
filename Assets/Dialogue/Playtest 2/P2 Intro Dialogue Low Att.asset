    - ...Hi there.
    - So, like I said, I have another playtest ready. Maybe this time you'll like
      it.
    - '*sigh*, sorry, I''m being too grumpy.'
    - I'm just really not great with criticism.
    - It's like, you know, you spend *so* much time and effort on something, and
      it gets completely dismissed and...
    - Wow, I'm just venting right now. Sorry, let's reset. I've made it better! The
      game is hopefully improved!
    - So yeah, let's try to push negative thoughts aside and have ourselves a playtest.
    - Uh.. yeah, just open the files the same as last time.
