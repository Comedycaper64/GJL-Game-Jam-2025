    - There we go, it works! (chuckle) Wow, it's weird seeing it on someone else's
      screen.
    - Oh, the controls! Uhhh so use W,A,S,D to move... uh you can attack by Left
      Clicking... you have a dash if you press Spacebar... yeah that should be all
      you need for now.
    - So I'll be asking you questions about how you're finding the game, but also
      let me know if you have any feedback as well.
    - And... yeah, that's the Hero, you play as a knight in a dungeon.
    - Uhhh, yeah that's all I wanted to say at the beginning here, so feel free to
      continue through the level.
