    - Oh, there you are!
    - Thanks again for coming, I've been struggling to find anyone free to do a playtest,
      so you reaching out was a miracle!
    - I've been working on this for quite a bit now, so I'm excited to finally show
      it off!
    - Uh you'll be the first playtester, and watching you play will let me know if
      the game needs any changes, or if there are any bugs I need to fix.
    - So uhhh... yeah, launch up the game when you're ready. Just extract those files
      I sent and it should hopefully run!
