    - Woah! Is that an adventurerr?! Am I seeing things?
    - Wow! This place hasn't had a visitor in centuries!
    - I've gotten pretty bored of eating cobwebs here, so you're a sight for sore
      eyes!
    - Now, I don't wanna get too cliche, but you're needed here!
    - Things are bad... real bad. Wack as hell.
    - You gotta take care of things, otherwise we're all screwed!
    - I believe in you buddy! And hey, if you get outta here alive? Food's on me.
